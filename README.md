NeoGuilder

NeoGuilder is an ERC-20 token with taxation, burning, and staking, deployed on the Sepolia testnet. It comes with a frontend (ethers.js), unit tests, and a Hardhat setup for local testing and deployment.

Inspired by the Guilder, the world's first global currency, NeoGuilder is my first full blockchain project, where I tried to grasp as many Web3 concepts as possible in a short time.

🚀 Features

- Taxed Transactions (3% transfer tax)
- Token Burning
- Staking & Unstaking
- MetaMask Wallet Integration
- Unit Tests with Hardhat
- Basic Frontend (ethers.js) 

🛠️ Planned Features

- A unique NFT owned by the largest NeoGuilder holder
- NeoGuilderDAO for governance
